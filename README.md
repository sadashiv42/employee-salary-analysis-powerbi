 Employee Salary & Department Analysis – Power BI Dashboard
- Objective

The goal of this project is to analyze employee salary data across departments to uncover insights about salary distribution, department spending, and workforce trends.

- Key Analyses & Visuals

Total Salary per Department (Bar Chart)

IT has the highest total salary spend, significantly higher than other departments.

R&D and HR have the lowest total salary allocations.

Employees Above Department Average Salary (Table)

Identifies high-performing employees earning more than their department average.

Useful for HR reviews and salary adjustment policies.

Salary Rank within Department (Table)

Shows employee ranking based on salary within their department.

Helps in identifying top earners and pay gaps.

Employees Joining Trend (Line Chart)

Trend of employees joining per year, broken down by department.

IT and Sales show the largest hiring surges around 2015–2020.

Salary Quartile Distribution (Stacked Column)

Employees are split into 4 quartiles within departments.

Most employees fall in Quartile 2 & 3 → balanced but skewed salary distribution.

- Business Insights

IT Department dominates salary spend (~35% of total company salary).

Finance has high salaries but spread across fewer employees.

Steady headcount growth till 2020, slight decline after 2023.

Quartile analysis shows pay inequality in IT vs. more balanced salaries in smaller departments.

- Tools & Techniques

SQL (to extract and preprocess data).

Power BI (to visualize trends and generate insights).

Window Functions (NTILE, Rank, Dense_Rank) for salary analysis.
